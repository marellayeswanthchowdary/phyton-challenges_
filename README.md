L = 24 (number of letters excluding spaces)
M = 24 % 3 = 0
Personalization Rule Used:
I applied the rule:
If M = 0, remove Low demand requests.
If M = 1, remove Moderate demand requests.
If M = 2, remove High demand requests.
Since M = 0 in my case, I removed all Low demand requests after categorizing the resource demands.
